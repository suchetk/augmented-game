# Catch2 AR Game

Catch2 is an augmented-reality game where the player must use a real-life object to catch computer-generated balls falling from the top of the webcam feed. As time goes on, the balls drop faster and faster. The player must be quick to catch all the balls. Ten drops are afforded to the player and if they are all used, the game is over. Any red object in good lighting will work, but a red solo cup is recommended.
